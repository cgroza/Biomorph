* Tasks
** TODO Create buttons in the control panel
Next generation, settings and reset.

** TODO Fix turning algorithm
- [X]Debug algorithm: measure counter-clockwise angle from previous to next.\\
  Use the cross product to differentiate concavity.
  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product#/media/File:Cross_product.gif][Cross Product Description]] 
- Create turning function for the reverse direction.
* Methods

** Polygons defined as lists of points
** Comparison of polygons by integral of turning function
[[https://sites.google.com/site/turningfunctions/][Turning function algorithm]]
** Mutation of points

* Usage
The buttons on the top of the window can be used.
To proceed to the next generation, press enter.
To open the configuration window, press space.
* Conclusion
** Number of generations necessary to achieve shapes
** Fidelity of the reproduction of the target polygon
