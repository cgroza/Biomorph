# Description
Biomorph is a program that simulates evolution and natural selection using polygons.
Polygons are mutated randomly and the user is allowed to select the best fit individuals
every generation. A target shape can also be given and the program will select and
display generations using a turning function algorithm to compare similarity.
The selection algorithm uses a turn function to calculate the similarity between two polygons.
